	                    celebratory fireworks at a wedding led to the rupturing of both of a man’s eardrums, according to a brief report of the man's case.the 30-year-old man went to the emergency room in switzerland after an explosion from the fireworks accidentally went off close to where he was standing, according to the report, published today (may 10) in the new england journal of medicine .the eardrum, which is also called the tympanic membrane, is a thin membrane inside the ear canal. when sound waves hit the eardrum, it vibrates. however, very loud noises , which produce very large sound waves, can cause the eardrum to tear, according to the mayo clinic .eardrum ruptures are not uncommon, said dr. patrick dubach, an ear, nose and throat doctor at solothurn hospital in switzerland who treated the man. dubach said he sees a ruptured eardrum about once every two months, but in most cases, fireworks are not the cause. a more common source of the injury is when a person inserts a q-tip too far into his or her ear, dubach said. when the man arrived at the hospital, he was experiencing hearing loss and a ringing in his ears, a problem known as tinnitus, according to the report. the doctors tested the man's hearing and found that he had experienced mild ""conductive"" hearing loss and moderate ""sensorineural"" hearing loss, according to the report.conductive hearing loss occurs when the structures of the ear, including the eardrum, are damaged, according to the hearing loss association of america (hlaa). in the man's case, his conductive hearing loss was due to the rupturing of his eardrums, dubach told live science.sensorineural hearing loss, on the other hand, refers to hearing loss caused by damage to either the tiny cells, called hair cells , found within in the inner ear or to the nerves that are related to hearing, the hlaa says. acoustic trauma, or very loud noise, is one of the things that can damage the cells of the inner ear, dubach said.in addition to hearing loss, ruptured eardrums can lead to other problems, dubach said. for example, a ruptured eardrum can open the ear up to bacterial infections , dubach said. this is because the eardrum doesn't only play a role in hearing; it also acts as a barrier to keep bacteria out.it's possible for cysts, called cholesteatomas, to form in the ear of someone with a ruptured eardrum, too, dubach said. these cysts provide a friendly breeding ground for bacteria and contain proteins that can damage the bones in the ear, according to the mayo clinic.ruptured eardrums can also lead to vertigo and balance problems, dubach added.in most cases, a ruptured eardrum will heal in a few weeks on its own, according the mayo clinic. but sometimes, a short medical procedure or surgery is needed, the mayo clinic says.in the man's case, the doctors repaired his eardrums using a procedure called patching, according to the report. during the procedure, doctors seal the hole in the eardrum with a small patch, according to the mayo clinic.three months later, the man's eardrums had healed, and his hearing had returned to the normal, the doctors wrote.originally published on live science .view allthis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2017 fox news network, llc. all rights reserved. all market data delayed 20 minutes."

the family of a south carolina teen who collapsed and later died after consuming an excessive amount of caffeine is speaking out to warn others about the potential dangers of energy drinks and other stimulants.“it wasn’t a car crash that took his life,” sean cripe said of his 16-year-old son davis, according to usa today. “instead, it was an energy drink. parents, please talk to your kids about these energy drinks. and teenagers and students: please stop buying them.”energy drinks may be risky for people with genetic heart conditionon april 26, davis allen cripe consumed a large diet mountain dew, a cafe latte from mcdonald’s and an energy drink in a span of two hours. he then collapsed at his spring hill high school and later died at palmetto health baptist parkridge hospital. the richland county coroner said on monday that the official cause of death was a “caffeine-induced cardiac event causing a probable arrhythmia.”“davis, like so many other kids and so many other people out there today, was doing something (he) thought was totally harmless, and that was ingesting lots of caffeine,” coroner gary watts said in a news conference. “we lost davis from a totally legal substance.”watts said cripe was healthy and had no family history of a medical problem that could have been exacerbated by the high levels of caffeine in his system, according to usa today.ex-espner had miscarriage during live broadcastdr. teo mendez, an orthopedic surgeon at new york orthopedics, told fox news that part of the danger is not knowing exactly how much caffeine is in these energy drinks.“when you start having these energy drinks there’s a wide variability in the amount of caffeine in them,” mendez told fox news. “for example a red bull has 80 mg of caffeine, some of these other energy drinks that they call red line could have up to 500 mg of caffeine – so seven times as much.he also warned on the other stimulants like guarana that are added to these drinks and contain twice the amount of caffeine as a coffee bean. the american academy of pediatrics recommends children and adolescents under 18 should not consume these energy drinks, which mendez agrees with. “i think if you’re under 18, i would follow the guidelines of the american academy of pediatrics,” he said. “we really should be monitoring our kids and not allowing them to be drinking energy drinks.”mom dies day after giving birth to healthy baby boymendez said his warning is especially true for teenage athletes who can be confused by the difference between an energy drink and a sport drink. some telltale warning signs of toxic doses of caffeine include anxiety, sweat, increased blood pressure, heart palpitations, headaches and generally feelings of nervousness.“[parents] should be vigilant, especially with young kids, you need to tell them to stay away from these energy drinks,” he said.  watts said cripe had a history of drinking caffeinated beverages but the family said it had not reached the levels of addiction.  “the purpose here today is not to slam mountain dew, not to slam café lattes, or energy drinks,” watts said on monday, according to nbc news. “but what we want to do is to make people understand that these drinks – this amount of caffeine, how it’s ingested, can have dire consequences. and that’s what happened in this case.” this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 fox news network, llc. all rights reserved. all market data delayed 20 minutes.

national security adviser h.r. mcmaster on tuesday adamantly defended president trump’s conversations with russian officials as “wholly appropriate,” pushing back for a second day on a news report claiming the president revealed highly classified information on an islamic state terror threat during that meeting.  during a tense white house briefing, mcmaster also ripped the leaks fueling such media reports – and said the president was not “even aware” of the source of the information he apparently shared with the russians.“he wasn’t briefed on the source and method of the information,” mcmaster said.mcmaster’s central contention was that the details discussed in that meeting concerned ongoing operations that were public for months and information available in “open source reporting.”“the president in no way compromised any sources or methods in the course of this conversation,” mcmaster said.the same official publicly had refuted the washington post report on monday evening, describing the claims as false.the president himself has since acknowledged he shared “facts” about the terror threat with russia, while saying he was in his right to do so. trump spoke briefly about the controversy tuesday in between meetings with visiting turkish president recep tayyip erdogan. he said he had a “very, very successful meeting” with the russian foreign minister earlier this month, and the u.s. wants to get as much help as possible in the fight against terrorism.“we're going to have a lot of great success over the next coming years,” trump said. mcmaster on tuesday continued to dispute the premise of the post story. while acknowledging trump shared information with the russians, he maintained the discussion was appropriate.“i stand by my statement that i made yesterday … the premise of that article is false,” he said. “… that conversation was wholly appropriate.”the white house has not explicitly denied classified information was shared, but has – along with the kremlin – denied the framing of the original report. mcmaster denied that the conversation was inappropriate or that it resulted in any lapse in security.rather, he said the leaks are what put security at risk.“the national security has been put at risk by those violating confidentiality,” mcmaster said. the new york times reported tuesday afternoon that the intelligence in question was actually provided by israel.ron dermer, israeli ambassador to the united states, said in a statement responding to the report: ""israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the united states and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under president trump.""the washington post report has only fueled tensions on capitol hill, where democrats and some republicans are fuming over trump’s decision last week to fire fbi director james comey. some democrats suggest he did so to blunt the investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 presidential race and alleged ties to the trump campaign, and the revelation of sensitive information being shared with moscow only stoked that political fire.  trump reportedly shared information about an isis threat involving the use of laptops on planes. the post report quoted unnamed officials saying he revealed the city where an intelligence partner detected the threat.on capitol hill, lawmakers raised concerns about the implications of such information being disclosed, especially to the russians.cia director mike pompeo plans to brief house intelligence committee members late tuesday. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., on tuesday downplayed the developments, but also told bloomberg business tv “we could do with a little less drama from the white house on a lot of things” so lawmakers can focus on a policy agenda. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 fox news network, llc. all rights reserved. all market data delayed 20 minutes.

""services that bridge the digital and physical worlds are the key to taking the virtual shoeboxes we all keep in the cloud back into the real world and making them accessible.""in addition, the assistant will come to ge appliances like refrigerators, dishwashers, ovens and other machines. in recent months, amazon has expanded the presence of its own voice assistant, alexa, bringing alexa to lg refrigerators as well as televisions made by other device makers. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 fox news network, llc. all rights reserved. all market data delayed 20 minutes.

note: i wrote this before the latest despicable, dishonest smearing of the president, but that incident simplify magnifies my case.here is what national security adviser lieutenant general h. r. mcmaster said monday in response to the latest washington press corps hysteria:""there's nothing that the president takes more seriously than the security of the american people. the story that came out tonight as reported is false. the president and the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries including threats to civil aviation. at no time, at no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed. and the president did not discuss any military operations that were not already publicly known. two other senior officials who were present, including the secretary of state, remember the meeting the same way and have said so. their on-the-record accounts should outweigh anonymous sources. and i was in the room, it didn’t happen.""this simply reinforces the following, which i wrote earlier today.after almost four months of watching the news media’s unending dishonesty, hostility, and contempt toward the trump administration, it is time to have a blunt conversation.the president owes americans the defense of the united states constitution.the president owes the american people a sound job as commander in chief, protecting the country.the president owes the american people a dramatically stronger economy with more jobs, better take home pay, and increased opportunities for investment growth; which will help people prepare for retirement, strengthen pension funds, and guarantee social security’s solvency.the president owes the american people a better health system with greater access, lower costs, and better health outcomes.indeed, the president owes the american people many things.but the president does not owe anything to the washington press corps and the left-wing hypocrites who dominate today's news media.i first learned this rule after reading the transcript from president franklin d. roosevelt’s opening press conference with the white house press corps on march 8, 1933. during fdr’s inaugural meeting with the press, no one was permitted to directly quote the president except via a prepared quote from his office. the vast majority of the conversation was either without attribution or completely off the record. the purpose of the meeting was for the media to understand what was going on – not for them to play gotcha or win clever attacks disguised as questions. those were the rules.since watergate, the news media has acquired a steadily more arrogant attitude and has moved further and further to the left. today, they are adversarial opponents of conservatives– especially the trump administration.i learned the hard way as speaker of the house that i could not regularly meet with reporters on camera. it set up an arena for gotcha questions. reporters gained imaginary points for finding stupid, narrow, often irrelevant things to argue over. instead of being an opportunity for a genuine public dialogue, the daily on-camera briefings became a bloody battleground – totally to my disadvantage. within a few weeks, we were forced to stop.president trump's instinct to radically overhaul his relationship with the media is exactly right.when reporters behave like picadors in daily briefings, trying desperately to taunt and embarrass sean spicer rather than listen and report on what he’s saying, it undermines our free society's right to accurate information. the daily briefing may draw big audiences as a reality television spectacle, but it does not serve the country or president trump well.while there remain some serious, historically-minded reporters, they are unfortunately becoming more of a rarity. instead, much of the washington press corps has become an incestuous collection of voyeurs who watch, judge, and attack without knowledge or responsibility. this creates a hostile, propagandistic, and distorted version of news coverage.a visit by egyptian president el-sisi to the white house last month led to a young american woman being released from an egyptian jail. had obama achieved this, it would have been lauded by the press as a major sign of leadership and compassion. however, because it was president trump, the media mostly ignored it.similarly, when the new relationship between president trump and the chinese president xi jinping directly resulted in a trade breakthrough for american beef, natural gas, and certain financial services, ending a 13-year period in which the chinese refused to buy american beef, we heard very little from the media. it should bring billions of dollars into the united states, yet the media felt it wasn’t important enough to cover.the recent jobs numbers – manufacturing, in particular – have been remarkable. but, of course, most washington reporters treat the release of these numbers as non-events. after all, this would mean they have to report good news, and in the left-wing newsrooms in which they are all so deeply embedded, positive news related to the president is simply not permissible.the president’s upcoming trip to saudi arabia, israel, the vatican, brussels and the g-7 in sicily is a remarkable tour for a new president – especially one who the media insisted knew nothing about international relations. but, of course, the washington news media wants to trivialize the trip with a discussion of white house gossip and whether the diplomatic journey will have a big domestic effect – as they define it.if you review the first four months of news coverage – much of which is based on unnamed sources – it becomes obvious how overwhelmingly negative, hostile, gossipy, and focused on undermining and weakening president trump and his team the press corps truly is.given a choice between writing a story about a big historic accomplishment and a petty piece about infighting in the white house, the washington press corps will go for the dirt every time. if washington is the swamp, the media is the muck.i challenge anyone to analyze the last four months of news coverage of president trump and come to the conclusion that it is unbiased, serious, or focused on important topics.my guess is, that you will unfortunately come to the same conclusion that i have. in this instance, president trump should take a note from fdr to remind the washington press corps that he works for the american people – not the elite media.newt gingrich is a fox news contributor. a
